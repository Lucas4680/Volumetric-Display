## 10/19/2025 - Recap of Past Work  

Over the course of the past few months, I've started brainstorming, researching, and building this project. So far, I've designed a first PCB design and spent countless time dealing with the many issues with this design. I've managed to get the display working but have decided to nearly completely redo the project building on all the knowledge I've gained from this first trial. Most of these issues came from lack of experience in PCB design and electronics.

(I would like to note that the rest of this project will be almost completely new and only build off past work)
