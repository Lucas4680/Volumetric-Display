# Volumetric-Display
A 3D display that utilizes a spinning transparent OLED. This is a version 2 overhaul of a previous project that did not work. Before, I had too little knowledge going into the project to pull off a working design. However, this time, I have completely changed the designs, PCB, and working principles for a much better and more solid display. At its core, it's a transparent OLED that rotates using a brushed motor. At each slice in its rotation, it displays a frame of a 3D image. As it spins, due to peristence of vision (the eye retains light for slightly longer than it exists), at high enough speeds, it looks like a solid 3D display. Below is the BOM as well as images of each component. Check out the journal to see my process of creating this project!
